# Marketing Campaign Component Documentation

This document provides detailed information about the Marketing Campaign component implementation with Material UI-inspired design and WCAG accessibility compliance.

## Overview

The Marketing Campaign component visualizes marketing campaign data with interactive charts and insights. It follows Material UI-inspired design principles and WCAG accessibility guidelines to provide a modern, clean, and accessible user interface.

## Component Structure

The component is structured as follows:

1. **MarketingCampaignDashboard.js** - The main dashboard component that handles data loading and processing.
2. **MarketingCampaignVisualizer.js** - The visualization component that renders charts and insights.
3. **Common Components**:
   - **DashboardLayout.js** - A Material UI-inspired layout component for all dashboards.
   - **DataInputCard.js** - A Material UI-inspired card component for data input.
   - **VisualizationCard.js** - A Material UI-inspired card component for visualizations.

## Material UI-Inspired Design Features

### 1. Color Palette

We've implemented a WCAG-compliant color palette based on Material Design principles:

- **Primary Color**: #6200EE (Purple)
- **Secondary Color**: #03DAC6 (Teal)
- **Error Color**: #B00020 (Red)
- **Warning Color**: #F57C00 (Orange)
- **Success Color**: #2E7D32 (Green)
- **Info Color**: #0277BD (Blue)

### 2. Typography

- Using Roboto font family for a clean, modern look
- Consistent font sizes and weights across the application
- Proper text hierarchy with clear headings and body text
- Enhanced text contrast for better readability

### 3. Elevation and Shadows

- Cards with different elevation levels (1-4) to create visual hierarchy
- Subtle shadows that provide depth without being distracting
- Hover effects that slightly elevate cards for better interaction feedback
- Border definition for better visual separation

### 4. Spacing and Layout

- Consistent spacing using an 8px grid system
- Clean, organized layout with proper alignment
- Responsive design that works well on different screen sizes
- Proper grouping of related information

### 5. Interactive Elements

- Badges with clear visual hierarchy
- Cards with consistent styling
- Charts with tooltips and interactive features
- Semantic grouping of related information

### 6. Visual Enhancements

- Gradient backgrounds for headers
- Custom icons for different platforms
- Color-coded strategy cards based on strategy type
- Platform badges with semantic colors and icons

## Charts and Visualizations

The Marketing Campaign component includes the following visualizations:

1. **Strategy Overview Pie Chart** - Shows the distribution of tactics across strategies.
2. **Budget Allocation Doughnut Chart** - Displays the allocation of budget across strategies.
3. **Tactics by Platform Bar Chart** - Visualizes the number of tactics for each platform.
4. **Strategy Cards** - Displays detailed information about each marketing strategy.
5. **Platform Tactics Cards** - Shows the tactics for each platform.

## Data Flow

1. The dashboard component loads example data from a JSON file or accepts custom JSON input.
2. The data is processed using the `extractMarketingCampaignData` function from `visualizationUtils.js`.
3. The processed data is passed to the visualizer component.
4. The visualizer component renders the charts and insights based on the processed data.

## CSS and Styling

We've implemented a comprehensive Material UI-inspired CSS framework:

1. **material-ui-theme.css** - Global CSS variables and utility classes for Material Design.
2. **Inline styles** - Component-specific styles using the React inline style approach.
3. **Bootstrap integration** - Enhanced Bootstrap components with Material Design styling.

## Accessibility Improvements (WCAG Compliance)

We've enhanced the component to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards:

1. **Color Contrast**: Updated all colors to meet WCAG AA standards (minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text and 3:1 for large text)
   - Text colors are now darker for better readability
