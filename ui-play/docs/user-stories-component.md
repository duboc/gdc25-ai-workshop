# User Stories Component Documentation

This document provides detailed information about the User Stories component implementation with Material UI-inspired design and WCAG accessibility compliance.

## Overview

The User Stories component visualizes user stories data with interactive charts and insights. It follows Material UI-inspired design principles and WCAG accessibility guidelines to provide a modern, clean, and accessible user interface.

## Component Structure

The component is structured as follows:

1. **UserStoriesDashboard.js** - The main dashboard component that handles data loading and processing.
2. **UserStoriesVisualizer.js** - The visualization component that renders charts and insights.
3. **Common Components**:
   - **DashboardLayout.js** - A Material UI-inspired layout component for all dashboards.
   - **DataInputCard.js** - A Material UI-inspired card component for data input.
   - **VisualizationCard.js** - A Material UI-inspired card component for visualizations.

## Material UI-Inspired Design Features

### 1. Color Palette

We've implemented a WCAG-compliant color palette based on Material Design principles:

- **Primary Color**: #6200EE (Purple)
- **Secondary Color**: #03DAC6 (Teal)
- **Error Color**: #B00020 (Red)
- **Warning Color**: #F57C00 (Orange)
- **Success Color**: #2E7D32 (Green)
- **Info Color**: #0277BD (Blue)

### 2. Typography

- Using Roboto font family for a clean, modern look
- Consistent font sizes and weights across the application
- Proper text hierarchy with clear headings and body text
- Enhanced text contrast for better readability

### 3. Elevation and Shadows

- Cards with different elevation levels (1-4) to create visual hierarchy
- Subtle shadows that provide depth without being distracting
- Hover effects that slightly elevate cards for better interaction feedback
- Border definition for better visual separation

### 4. Spacing and Layout

- Consistent spacing using an 8px grid system
- Clean, organized layout with proper alignment
- Responsive design that works well on different screen sizes
- Proper grouping of related information

### 5. Interactive Elements

- Badges with clear visual hierarchy
- Cards with consistent styling
- Charts with tooltips and interactive features
- Semantic grouping of related information

### 6. Visual Enhancements

- Gradient backgrounds for headers
- Custom icons for different themes
- Color-coded story cards based on theme
- Priority badges with semantic colors

## Charts and Visualizations

The User Stories component includes the following visualizations:

1. **Theme Breakdown Pie Chart** - Shows the distribution of stories across themes.
2. **Story Points by Theme Bar Chart** - Displays the total story points for each theme.
3. **Story Priority Matrix Scatter Chart** - Visualizes the distribution of stories by priority and story points.
4. **User Story Cards** - Displays detailed information about each user story in a card format.

## Data Flow

1. The dashboard component loads example data from a JSON file or accepts custom JSON input.
2. The data is processed using the `extractUserStoriesData` function from `visualizationUtils.js`.
3. The processed data is passed to the visualizer component.
4. The visualizer component renders the charts and insights based on the processed data.

## CSS and Styling

We've implemented a comprehensive Material UI-inspired CSS framework:

1. **material-ui-theme.css** - Global CSS variables and utility classes for Material Design.
2. **Inline styles** - Component-specific styles using the React inline style approach.
3. **Bootstrap integration** - Enhanced Bootstrap components with Material Design styling.

## Data Processing Improvements

We've made significant improvements to the data processing logic:

1. **Theme Breakdown Calculation**: Implemented proper calculation of story counts and percentages by theme.
2. **Story Points Calculation**: Added visualization of story points by theme.
3. **Priority Matrix**: Implemented a scatter chart to visualize stories by priority and story points.
4. **Theme Grouping**: Added grouping of stories by theme for better organization.
5. **Priority Mapping**: Implemented mapping of priority levels to numeric values for visualization.

## Accessibility Improvements (WCAG Compliance)

We've enhanced the component to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards:

1. **Color Contrast**: Updated all colors to meet WCAG AA standards (minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text and 3:1 for large text)
   - Text colors are now darker for better readability
   - Background colors have been adjusted for proper contrast
   - Chart colors use an accessible palette with sufficient contrast

2. **Semantic HTML Improvements**:
   - Added appropriate ARIA attributes to interactive elements
   - Improved semantic structure with proper heading hierarchy
   - Added role attributes to non-semantic elements

3. **Focus Indicators**:
   - Enhanced focus styles for interactive elements
   - Added visible focus outlines that meet contrast requirements

4. **Text Readability**:
   - Increased font weights for better readability
   - Improved line spacing and text sizing
   - Enhanced text contrast throughout the application

5. **Non-text Contrast**:
   - Added borders to UI components for better definition
   - Improved contrast for icons and graphical elements
   - Enhanced visual separation between UI elements

6. **Chart Accessibility**:
   - Implemented an accessible color palette for charts
   - Added white borders between chart elements for better distinction
   - Improved tooltip contrast and readability
   - Enhanced chart labels with better contrast

## Chart.js Configuration

We've configured Chart.js with WCAG-compliant styling:

1. **Pie Chart**:
   - Custom tooltips with improved contrast
   - Larger hover offset for better visibility
   - Proper legend styling with point styles
   - Accessible color palette

2. **Bar Chart**:

## Theme-Specific Styling

We've implemented theme-specific styling to enhance the visual distinction between different story themes:

1. **Gameplay**: Purple color scheme (#6200EE)
2. **Ads**: Blue color scheme (#0277BD)
3. **Technical Issues**: Red color scheme (#B00020)
4. **Game Improvements**: Green color scheme (#2E7D32)
5. **General Praise**: Orange color scheme (#F57C00)
6. **Graphics**: Teal color scheme (#018786)
7. **UX**: Gray color scheme (#455A64)

This color-coding is consistent across all visualizations, making it easier to identify and track themes throughout the dashboard.

## Priority Matrix Visualization

1. **Priority Levels**: Visualizes stories by priority (High, Medium, Low).
2. **Story Points**: Displays the story points for each story.
3. **Theme Grouping**: Groups stories by theme with consistent colors.
4. **Interactive Tooltips**: Provides detailed information about each story on hover.
5. **Legend**: Explains the meaning of each priority level.

## User Story Cards

We've implemented a user story card visualization that includes:

1. **Theme Header**: Color-coded header based on the story theme.
2. **Priority Badge**: Badge indicating the priority level of the story.
3. **Story Format**: Structured display of the user story in the "As a... I want... So that..." format.
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: List of acceptance criteria for the story.
5. **Theme Icon**: Icon representing the story theme.

## Future Improvements

2. Implement dark mode support
3. Add more interactive features to the charts
4. Enhance accessibility features further
5. Add export functionality for charts and insights
6. Implement data caching for better performance
7. Add filtering capabilities for stories by theme or priority
