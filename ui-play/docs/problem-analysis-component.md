# Problem Analysis Component Documentation

This document provides detailed information about the Problem Analysis component implementation with Material UI-inspired design.

## Overview

The Problem Analysis component visualizes problem analysis data with interactive charts and insights. It follows a Material UI-inspired design approach to provide a modern, clean, and engaging user interface.

## Component Structure

The component is structured as follows:

1. **ProblemAnalysisDashboard.js** - The main dashboard component that handles data loading and processing.
2. **ProblemAnalysisVisualizer.js** - The visualization component that renders charts and insights.
3. **Common Components**:
   - **DashboardLayout.js** - A Material UI-inspired layout component for all dashboards.
   - **DataInputCard.js** - A Material UI-inspired card component for data input.
   - **VisualizationCard.js** - A Material UI-inspired card component for visualizations.

## Material UI-Inspired Design Features

### 1. Color Palette

We've implemented a consistent color palette based on Material Design principles:

- **Primary Color**: #7C4DFF (Purple)
- **Secondary Color**: #00E5FF (Cyan)
- **Accent Colors**: Various gradients and shades for different visualization elements

### 2. Typography

- Using Roboto font family for a clean, modern look
- Consistent font sizes and weights across the application
- Proper text hierarchy with clear headings and body text

### 3. Elevation and Shadows

- Cards with different elevation levels (1-4) to create visual hierarchy
- Subtle shadows that provide depth without being distracting
- Hover effects that slightly elevate cards for better interaction feedback

### 4. Spacing and Layout

- Consistent spacing using an 8px grid system
- Clean, organized layout with proper alignment
- Responsive design that works well on different screen sizes

### 5. Interactive Elements

- Buttons with hover and active states
- Form elements with focus states
- Charts with tooltips and interactive features

### 6. Visual Enhancements

- Gradient backgrounds for headers
- Custom icons for different sections
- Badge styling for status indicators
- Card styling with accent colors

## Charts and Visualizations

The Problem Analysis component includes the following visualizations:

1. **Problem Categories Pie Chart** - Shows the distribution of problem categories.
2. **Severity/Frequency Matrix Bubble Chart** - Displays problems based on their severity and frequency.
3. **User Segment Impact Bar Chart** - Shows the impact of problems on different user segments.
4. **Actionable Insights List** - Displays actionable insights with priority indicators.

## Data Flow

1. The dashboard component loads example data from a JSON file or accepts custom JSON input.
2. The data is processed using the `extractProblemAnalysisData` function from `visualizationUtils.js`.
3. The processed data is passed to the visualizer component.
4. The visualizer component renders the charts and insights based on the processed data.

## CSS and Styling

We've implemented a comprehensive Material UI-inspired CSS framework:

1. **material-ui-theme.css** - Global CSS variables and utility classes for Material Design.
2. **Inline styles** - Component-specific styles using the React inline style approach.
3. **Bootstrap integration** - Enhanced Bootstrap components with Material Design styling.

## Implementation Details

### DashboardLayout Component

- Gradient header with title and description
- Loading and error states
- Clean, organized content area

### DataInputCard Component

- Sections for example data and custom JSON input
- Material-styled buttons and form elements
- Visual feedback for user interactions

### VisualizationCard Component

- Customizable elevation levels
- Accent color options
- Icon support for better visual identification
- Clean header and body styling

### ProblemAnalysisVisualizer Component

- Enhanced chart styling with Material Design colors
- Custom tooltips for better data exploration
- Stat cards for key metrics
- Styled badges for segments
- Insight cards with priority indicators

## Data Processing Improvements

We've made significant improvements to the data processing logic to handle different data structures:

1. **Enhanced Data Extraction**: The `extractProblemAnalysisData` function now handles various data structures and formats, making it more robust.
2. **Improved Error Handling**: Added better error handling and fallbacks for missing or malformed data.
3. **Normalized Data Structure**: Standardized the data structure for charts and visualizations to ensure consistency.
4. **Empty Data Handling**: Added specific handling for empty arrays and missing data to prevent rendering issues.
5. **Severity Mapping**: Improved the mapping of severity values to numeric scales for better visualization.

## Accessibility Improvements (WCAG Compliance)

We've enhanced the component to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards:

1. **Color Contrast**: Updated all colors to meet WCAG AA standards (minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text and 3:1 for large text)
   - Text colors are now darker for better readability
   - Background colors have been adjusted for proper contrast
   - Chart colors use an accessible palette with sufficient contrast

2. **Semantic HTML Improvements**:
   - Added appropriate ARIA attributes to interactive elements
   - Improved semantic structure with proper heading hierarchy
   - Added role attributes to non-semantic elements

3. **Focus Indicators**:
   - Enhanced focus styles for interactive elements
   - Added visible focus outlines that meet contrast requirements

4. **Text Readability**:
   - Increased font weights for better readability
   - Improved line spacing and text sizing
   - Enhanced text contrast throughout the application

5. **Non-text Contrast**:
   - Added borders to UI components for better definition
   - Improved contrast for icons and graphical elements
   - Enhanced visual separation between UI elements

## Future Improvements

1. Add animation effects for chart transitions
2. Implement dark mode support
3. Add more interactive features to the charts
4. Enhance accessibility features
5. Add export functionality for charts and insights
6. Implement data caching for better performance
7. Add filtering capabilities for problem categories and segments

## Running the Application

To run the application:

1. Start the API server:
```
cd api-play
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

2. Start the UI server:
```
cd ui-play
npm install
npm start
```

3. Navigate to the Problem Analysis tab to see the visualizations in action.
