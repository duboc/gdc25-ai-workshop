# Expanded General Sentiment Analysis

**Objective:** Perform a comprehensive sentiment analysis of user reviews to understand overall user perception and identify key areas for improvement.

**Dataset:** You will be provided with a CSV file containing user reviews. The file includes the following columns:

*   `content`: The full text of the user review.
*   `score`: A numerical rating provided by the user (this may not accurately reflect sentiment).
*   `thumbs up`: A binary value indicating whether the user gave a thumbs-up to the review.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Sentiment Classification:** Analyze the `content` column of each review and classify its sentiment as one of the following:

    *   `Positive`: Expressing satisfaction, approval, or enthusiasm.
    *   `Negative`: Expressing dissatisfaction, disapproval, or frustration.
    *   `Neutral`: Expressing neither positive nor negative sentiment.

    **Important:** Disregard the `score` and `thumbs up` columns for this classification step, focusing solely on the textual content.

2.  **Sentiment Distribution Analysis:** Calculate and provide the approximate percentage distribution of reviews for each sentiment category (Positive, Negative, Neutral). This will provide an overview of the overall user sentiment towards the application.

3.  **Theme and Keyword Identification:** For each sentiment category (Positive, Negative, Neutral), identify the most prominent themes and keywords. Specifically, focus on:

    *   **Praised Features/Aspects:** What do users highlight positively?
    *   **Criticized Features/Aspects:** What do users complain about or dislike?
    *   **Reported Issues/Bugs:** Are there recurring problems mentioned?
    *   **Improvement Suggestions:** What do users want to see changed or added?

4.  **Executive Summary:** Present a concise summary of the overall sentiment analysis, including:

    *   The dominant sentiment trend (e.g., "Predominantly Positive", "Mostly Negative", "Mixed Sentiment").
    *   Key areas of praise and criticism.
    *   Any significant issues or improvement areas revealed by the analysis.
    *   The distribution of positive, negative, and neutral sentiment as percentages.

**Output Requirements:**

*   A clear list of sentiments with their calculated percentage.  (e.g., Positive: 60%, Negative: 25%, Neutral: 15%)
*   A concise text-based summary of themes for each sentiment category. (e.g., Positive:  Users praise the ease of use and intuitive interface. Negative: Users complain about frequent crashes and lack of customer support.)
*   A concluding summary highlighting main insights and recommendations.

**Key Considerations:**

*   Focus on the textual content of the `content` column for accurate sentiment analysis, disregarding numerical scores.
*   Aim to identify both explicit statements of sentiment and implied sentiment.
*   Provide actionable insights that can be used to guide development and improve user experience.
