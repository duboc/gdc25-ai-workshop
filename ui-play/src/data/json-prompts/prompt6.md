Specific Guidance:

Campaign Strategies: Develop strategies that directly correlate to the sentiment analysis findings. For example:

If "Usability" is a strong positive, create a campaign highlighting ease of use.

If "Performance" is a weakness, create a campaign focusing on improvements and updates.

If there is a positive trend over time, create a campaign reinforcing the product's positive evolution.

Tactics: For each strategy, provide a range of specific marketing tactics. These can include social media posts, in-app messaging, influencer marketing, blog posts, email campaigns, performance-focused ad campaigns, etc.

Platforms: Detail the platforms for each tactic such as Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, etc.

Measurement Metrics: For each strategy identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to measure success of each strategy and overall campaign.

Tone & Style:

Use a positive and solution-oriented tone.

Maintain consistency in language, format, and overall tone throughout the entire campaign proposal.

The generated campaign proposal should be data-driven, and demonstrate an understanding of the user feedback by the sentiment analysis output.
