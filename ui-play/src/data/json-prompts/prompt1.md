# Problems and Suggestions

**Objective:** Analyze user reviews from a CSV file (columns: 'content', 'score', 'at') to identify problems, suggestions, and trends over time. Deliver actionable insights for developers and product managers.

**Analysis Tasks (Ordered by Priority):**

1. **Negative Review Problem Analysis:**
    * **Sentiment-Based Negativity:**  Analyze 'content' to identify *negative* reviews (ignore 'score' for sentiment).
    * **Problem Categorization:** Classify negative reviews into these categories:
        * Bugs/Glitches
        * Feature Issues
        * Performance Problems
        * Usability Issues
        * Content/Quality Issues
        * Other (please specify if possible)
    * **Frequency Count:** Calculate the number of reviews in each problem category.
    * **Example Reviews:** For each category, provide 2-3 example 'content' excerpts with their 'at' dates.
    * **Time-Based Trend (Problem Categories):** Analyze if the frequency of each problem category is increasing, decreasing, or stable over time. Indicate trend direction (increasing, decreasing, stable) for each category.
    * **Severity Classification:** Classify each problem category as 'Critical', 'Major', or 'Minor' based on its impact on user experience.

2. **Suggestion & Feature Request Analysis:**
    * **Suggestion Extraction:** Extract suggestions and feature requests from *all* reviews (positive, negative, neutral).
    * **Suggestion Grouping:** Group extracted suggestions into logical themes (e.g., "Payment Options," "Search Functionality," "Customization"). Aim for concise theme names.
    * **Frequency Count (Suggestions):** Count the number of reviews mentioning each suggestion group.
    * **Prioritization (Suggestions):** Rank suggestion groups by frequency. Estimate impact (High, Medium, Low) based on review context.
    * **Example Reviews (Suggestions):** For top suggestion groups, provide 1-2 example 'content' excerpts.
    * **Emerging Suggestions Trend:** Identify any *new* suggestion groups that appear in later reviews (based on 'at' date).
    * **Implementation Difficulty:** Estimate difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) for each suggestion group.

3. **Sentiment Trend Analysis:**
    * **Sentiment Evolution:** Track the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of reviews over time.
    * **Provide monthly or quarterly sentiment summary if possible.**
    * **Identify specific events or updates that might have affected sentiment.**

4. **Audience Segmentation (Optional):**
    * **User Type Analysis:** If possible, categorize users into groups based on their reviews (e.g., "Power Users", "Casual Users", "New Users").
    * **Segment-Specific Issues:** Identify problems that affect specific user segments more than others.

**Output Requirements:**

* **Format:** Return output in the exact JSON format specified below.
* **Structure:** Follow this schema precisely, including all fields:
