--- FTUE Criteria ---

1.  **Splash Screen to Interactive Game Time:** Measure the total time elapsed from the appearance of the splash screen(s) until the game is fully interactive on the main gameplay screen. Is this time reasonable? (Target: [You can add a target time if you have one, e.g., under 30 seconds])

2.  **Loading Screen Duration:**  Observe the maximum duration of any single loading screen. Is this duration reasonable and engaging, or does it feel excessively long? (Reasonable max time: [You can define what you consider reasonable, e.g., under 10 seconds without feedback])

3.  **Permission Request Explanation:**  Identify if the game requests any permissions (e.g., microphone, storage). If permissions are requested, is there a clear and concise explanation provided *before* the permission request is shown to the user, explaining *why* the permission is needed and how it enhances the experience?

4.  **Skippable Tutorial:**  Observe if a tutorial is presented to the user upon first launch. If a tutorial exists, is there a clear and easily accessible option to skip it?

5.  **Language Consistency:** Verify if the primary language used in the game's text (including UI elements, tutorial text, Terms of Service, and Privacy Policy links) matches the device's system language settings.

6.  **Login Requirement and Explanation:** Determine if login is mandatory upon first launch.
    *   If login is mandatory, is there a clear explanation provided about *why* login is required and how it benefits the user's experience?
    *   If mandatory, are there at least two login options available (e.g., Google, Facebook, Email) OR is automatic login via Google Play Services implemented?
    *   If login is optional or automatic, is this clearly indicated?

7.  **Automatic Google Play Services Login:**  Assess if the game automatically attempts to log in the user via Google Play Services upon first launch (if applicable and desired).  Is this implementation smooth and user-friendly?

8.  **Interstitials and Purchase Modals:**  Observe the frequency and intrusiveness of interstitial ads or purchase modals presented during the FTUE.
    *   Are "many" interstitials shown? Define "many" (e.g., more than 1 of the same type, or more than 2 of different types in the FTUE flow).
    *   Are purchase modals (or other modals encouraging actions) displayed that occupy more than 60% of the screen?
    *   Note the *types* of interstitials/modals observed.

9.  **Options Accessibility:**  Identify if there is a clear and accessible button or menu option (e.g., settings icon, pause menu) where users can access game options and settings.

10. **Start Game Clarity:** Evaluate how the game initiates gameplay.
    *   Is there a clear and evident "Start Game" button or equivalent call to action on the main screen?
    *   Or, does the game directly transition the user into a gameplay session or the main game hub (e.g., map, HQ, garage, etc.) upon reaching the main screen?
    *   Describe the entry point to the game (button, direct entry to map/HQ etc.).

11. **User Profile Visibility & Customization:**  Check if a user profile section is visible and accessible within the FTUE flow. Is there an option to customize the user profile (e.g., avatar, name)?

12. **Loading Status Feedback:** Observe if any screen remains without updated information or loading status feedback for more than 3 seconds during the FTUE. If so, note the screen and duration.
