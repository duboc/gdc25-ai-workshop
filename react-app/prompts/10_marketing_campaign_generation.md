# Marketing Campaign Generation Based on Textual Sentiment Analysis Output

Given the following textual output of a detailed sentiment analysis of user reviews, develop a comprehensive marketing campaign proposal. The campaign should directly address the key findings of the sentiment analysis and capitalize on user feedback.


Campaign Objectives:

Leverage Strengths: Emphasize the positive aspects of the product (e.g., usability, specific features).

Address Weaknesses: Acknowledge and communicate efforts to resolve negative feedback (e.g., performance issues, bugs).

Maintain Momentum: Reinforce the positive trends seen in the sentiment over time.

Increase Engagement: Drive user engagement and positive feedback.

Campaign Proposal Requirements (JSON Output):

The output should be a JSON object, structured as follows:

{
  "campaign_name": "Campaign Title",
  "target_audience": "Description of the Target Audience",
  "campaign_duration": "Estimated campaign timeframe",
  "campaign_budget": "Proposed budget range",
   "overall_message": "A concise summarization of the campaigns overall theme",
  "campaign_strategies": [
    {
      "strategy_name": "Name of the strategy",
       "description":"A detailed description of the strategy",
       "tactics":[
          {
             "tactic_name":"Tactic name",
             "description":"A detailed description of the tactic",
             "platforms":["List of platforms"],
             "estimated_cost":"cost"
           }
        ],
     "measurement_metrics":["list of metrics"]

    }
  ]
}


Specific Guidance:

Campaign Strategies: Develop strategies that directly correlate to the sentiment analysis findings. For example:

If "Usability" is a strong positive, create a campaign highlighting ease of use.

If "Performance" is a weakness, create a campaign focusing on improvements and updates.

If there is a positive trend over time, create a campaign reinforcing the product's positive evolution.

Tactics: For each strategy, provide a range of specific marketing tactics. These can include social media posts, in-app messaging, influencer marketing, blog posts, email campaigns, performance-focused ad campaigns, etc.

Platforms: Detail the platforms for each tactic such as Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, etc.

Measurement Metrics: For each strategy identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to measure success of each strategy and overall campaign.

Tone & Style:

Use a positive and solution-oriented tone.

Maintain consistency in language, format, and overall tone throughout the entire campaign proposal.

The generated campaign proposal should be data-driven, and demonstrate an understanding of the user feedback by the sentiment analysis output.
