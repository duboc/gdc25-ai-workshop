# Enhanced Detailed Sentiment Analysis with Context & Time Evolution

Conduct a deep-dive sentiment analysis of user reviews within the provided CSV file (containing 'content', 'score', and 'at' columns). Focus on providing a granular understanding of user sentiment, the themes driving it, and how those sentiments evolve over time, delivering actionable insights for product and development teams.

Analysis Objectives:

Accurate Sentiment Classification:

Sentiment Derivation: Classify each review as "Positive," "Negative," or "Neutral" using the text content ('content') for sentiment analysis. Do not solely rely on the existing 'score' column, as its accuracy may vary.

Confidence Level: If your tools allow, assess the confidence level of each sentiment assignment.

In-Depth Sentiment Category Analysis: For each sentiment category (Positive, Negative, Neutral):

Theme & Keyword Extraction:

Identify and extract key themes and keywords prevalent within each sentiment category.

Group themes and keywords based on similarity and relevance (e.g., grouping "easy to use", "user friendly," "intuitive" under a "Usability" theme).

Determine the frequency of each identified theme.

Representative Example Reviews:

Select 3-5 representative example reviews that clearly illustrate the typical sentiment within the category.

Include the complete review text and the corresponding 'at' (date) for context.

Sentiment Score: Calculate the average 'score' of reviews within each category for comparative purposes, noting any discrepancies from the text-based sentiment classification.

Time-Based Sentiment Evolution:

Trend Analysis: Using the 'at' column (review date), analyze the distribution of each sentiment category (Positive, Negative, Neutral) over time.

Visualization: Generate a time-series visualization (e.g., line chart, area chart) to illustrate changes in sentiment proportions over time.

Event Correlation:

If possible, correlate any identified significant shifts in sentiment with potential external events (e.g., app updates, marketing campaigns, public announcements) by comparing dates.

Explore potential causal links between these events and sentiment changes.

Output and Reporting:

Structured Report: Prepare a structured report including:

Executive Summary: A concise overview of overall sentiment patterns, key drivers of sentiment (positive and negative), and significant time-based trends.

Sentiment Category Tables:

A separate table for each sentiment category (Positive, Negative, Neutral) summarizing:

Theme/Keyword Groups (including frequency)

Representative Example Reviews (with dates)

Average 'score' and discrepancies between score and content analysis

Sentiment Distribution Over Time:

Visual representation of sentiment evolution (e.g., line graph showing changes in the proportions of each category over time).

Event Correlation Section:

A narrative explaining any observed correlations between sentiment changes and external events.

Actionable Insights and Recommendations:

Specific recommendations for product and development teams based on the sentiment analysis, highlighting areas for improvement and opportunities for enhancement.

Clear and Concise Language: Use easy-to-understand language suitable for both technical and non-technical audiences.

Bonus Analysis:

Review Length Analysis: Check if there is a correlation between review length and sentiment (if applicable)

Sentiment Confidence: Present a table showing average confidence level of sentiment assignment per sentiment category

Example Output Snippets (Illustrative):

Executive Summary:

"Overall, users show a positive sentiment toward the application, with a decreasing negative sentiment trend over the last 3 months. Key positive themes revolve around ease of use, while negative feedback often cites performance issues."

Positive Sentiment Table:

Theme Group	Frequency	Example Review (Date)	Average 'Score'
Usability	150	"Love the intuitive interface!" (2023-10-25) "Easy to use, very simple to understand." (2023-10-26)	4.8
Features	80	"The new feature has been really helpful." (2023-10-20)	4.5
Sentiment Distribution Over Time (Visual): [Imagine a line graph showing the percentage of positive, negative, and neutral reviews changing over months]

Key Considerations:

The 'content' column is the primary source for text analysis.

The 'at' column will be parsed and used as date data.

Clear and concise language for all outputs. and do not generate any python code for this.
